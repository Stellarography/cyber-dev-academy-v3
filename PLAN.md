# Project Plan: Cyber-Dev-Academy-v3

This document outlines the high-level plan and next steps for the cyber-dev-academy-v3 project. It will be used as a guiding document for development, collaboration, and AI-assisted workflows.

## I. Project Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To create a comprehensive, modern, and engaging online platform for training the next generation of full-stack developers and prompt engineers.

**Mission:** The platform will use the latest technologies like Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4 to provide a hands-on learning experience that goes beyond theoretical knowledge.

## II. Key Objectives

**A. User Authentication:** Implement a robust user sign-up and login system.

**B. Course Content:** Develop a core set of modules for Next.js, React, and Prompt Engineering.

**C. Interactive Editor:** Integrate a live code editor for hands-on exercises within the courses.

**D. AI Integration:** Utilize the Gemini API to provide real-time assistance and feedback to users on their code and prompts.

## III. Phase 1: Core Features

**Objective:** Establish the foundational components of the application.

**Tasks:**

### Auth System:

### Basic Navigation:
- Create a dynamic navigation bar that reflects the user's authentication status.

## IV. Phase 2: Content & AI Integration

**Objective:** Begin building out the core course material and AI-powered features.

**Tasks:**

### Course Structure:
- Create the data model for courses, modules, and lessons.
- Begin drafting the first few lessons for the Next.js module.

### API Integration:
- Integrate the Gemini API for prompt engineering exercises.
- Create a component that sends user input to the API and displays the response.

## V. Future Considerations

### Community Features:
